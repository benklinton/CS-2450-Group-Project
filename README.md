# CS-2450-Group-Project

The project creates a virtual machine that reads instruction files specified to it.

# Running Application Locally

specify route to program file to be executed
(I have put example program files in the ./programs folder)

```
node index.js <path to program>
```

### example

```
    node index.js ./programs/Test1.txt
```

# building

run

```
npm run build
```

The output will appear in a new folder called dist it should output each program for mac linux and windows

# notes

maybe we could consider using electron if needing to move forward for app gui
